# Contributor Guide for SharpShooter

Welcome to **SharpShooter**, a real-time multiplayer grid-based shooter written in Node.js. This guide gives both human contributors and Codex the context needed to work effectively in this repository.

---
## 1. Overview
SharpShooter consists of a lightweight Express + Socket.IO backend that maintains authoritative game state and a browser client that renders game frames with vanilla JS and TailwindCSS.

### Folder Map
| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `core/` | Core game loop, state management, and rule enforcement |
| `entities/` | Domain objects such as `Player`, `Projectile`, and `Grid` |
| `input/` | Client-side input handling (keyboard, touch, etc.) |
| `rendering/` | Renderer that draws the grid and entities to the `<canvas>` |
| `utils/` | Pure helper functions (math, collision, RNG) |
| `styles/` | Tailwind input & compiled CSS output |
| `server.js` | Entry point for the Node.js game server |
| `main.js` & `game.js` | Client bootstrap and high-level game orchestration |

## 2. Style Guidelines
* **ES Modules**: Use `import` / `export` syntax—no CommonJS (`require`).
* **Formatting**: 2-space indentation, single quotes, trailing commas where valid.
* **Naming**: camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes, UPPER_SNAKE for constants.
* **Commits**: Conventional commits, e.g. `feat(core): add power-up system`.

## 3. Validation Commands
Run these before opening a Pull Request (PR):
```bash
npm ci            # install exact deps
npm run lint       # eslint rules
npm test          # jest or vitest test suite
npm run build:css # make sure Tailwind compiles
```

Codex: use these commands to verify changes automatically.

---
## 4. Running Locally
```bash
npm start          # starts server at http://localhost:3000
npm run dev        # live reload + Tailwind watch
```

---
## 5. Game-logic Hotspots
If your task touches gameplay, start your search in these files:
* `core/Game.js` – main tick loop & state transitions
* `core/GameState.js` – serialisable game state
* `entities/Player.js` – movement, shooting cooldowns
* `entities/Projectile.js` – flight mechanics & collision

---
## 6. Files to Avoid Editing
* `styles/output.css` – generated by Tailwind
* `package-lock.json` – generated, edit only if dependency tree changes

---
## 7. PR Checklist
- [ ] All new/changed code is covered by unit tests
- [ ] `npm run lint` passes without warnings
- [ ] `npm test` is green
- [ ] Documentation updated (README, AGENTS.md, comments where relevant)

## 8. Codex-specific Advice
1. **Focus searches** in `core/`, `entities/`, and `utils/` when modifying gameplay.
2. **Write tests** whenever logic changes—place them in `__tests__/` mirroring the path.
3. **Avoid modifying** compiled or third-party files.
4. **Log output** went running commands that fail; include stderr so we can reproduce.
